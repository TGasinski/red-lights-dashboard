# red-lights-dashboard
This project was designed to highlight my data wrangling and visualization skills by creating an interactive dashboard which displays the total number of red camera violations in the city of Chicago, Illinois. It includes a count of total violations, a chart with the number of violations per day, and a map with the locations of the red light cameras and number of violations. 

# Motivation 
After viewing the December 2018 Kaggle Dashboard Training (https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/dashboarding-with-notebooks-day-1), I designed an interactive dashboard to display the total number of red camera violations in the city of Chicago, Illinois. These controversial cameras became popular in my hometown beginning around 2008 and have, as is relatively commonplace in the state, become embroiled in political scandals (https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/ban-proposed-on-red-light-cameras-heart-of-bribery-scheme/2213784/). As I myself have also been fined by one of these pesky cameras, I was curious to see how many other residents have suffered similar fates. 

# Data Sources
Both datasets, hosted by the City of Chicago, were initially accessed through Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-red-light-and-speed-camera-data). The "red-light-camera-violations" .csv file could not be uploaded due to its size, but can be downloaded through the provided Kaggle link.  

# How to use 
To run both the Cleaning and Wrangling.ipynb and Final.ipynb files, download the /input folder files and first run the Cleaning and Wrangling.ipynb file. To only view the dashboard, first download the /clean folder files.
